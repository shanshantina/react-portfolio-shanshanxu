  React Portfolio is a single-page application portfolio for myself:
  1. When user loads the portfolio, then user is presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.  
  2. When user views the header, then user is presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.      
  3. When user views the navigation titles, then user is presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
  4. When user clicks on a navigation title, then user is presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.
  5. When user loads the portfolio the first time, then the About Me title and section are selected by default.
  6. When user is presented with the About Me section, then user sees a recent photo of the developer and a short bio about them.
  7. When user is presented with the Portfolio section, then use sees titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.
  8. When user is presented with the Contact section, then user sees a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
  9. When user moves my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, then user receives a notification that this field is required.
  10. When user enters text into the email address field, then user receives a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.
  11. When user is presented with the Resume section, then user sees a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
  12. When user views the footer, then user is prompted to enter both a title and contents for my blog post.
